Multi-DC Environment Test Summary
=================================
Generated: 2025-08-04 18:04:47
This Server: dc3.guedry.local
Domain: guedry.local
Discovered DCs: 0 ()

Instructions for Multi-DC Testing:
==================================
1. Run this test suite on all 0 domain controllers
2. Compare results to identify inconsistencies across DCs
3. Test failover by stopping services on primary DC
4. Verify SYSVOL replication between all 0 DCs
5. Check priority-based coordination during failures

Test Commands for Each DC:
=========================
# Run comprehensive tests
./run-all-tests.sh

# Run specific test suites
./run-all-tests.sh --suite fsmo
./run-all-tests.sh --suite coordination

# Quick connectivity test
./run-all-tests.sh --quick

# Simulate failover (run on secondary DC while primary is stopped)
./run-all-tests.sh --simulate-failover

Coordination Testing Steps:
==========================
1. Verify all DCs can discover each other
2. Check priority configuration on all DCs
3. Test seizure coordination by simulating DC failure
4. Verify service failover works correctly
5. Check SYSVOL synchronization timing

Expected Results for Healthy Multi-DC Environment:
===================================================
- All 0 DCs should discover each other via DNS SRV records
- FSMO roles should be properly assigned (all 5 roles)
- Service failover should work within 5-10 minutes
- SYSVOL should replicate configurations across all 0 DCs
- Priority-based coordination should prevent conflicts regardless of DC count
